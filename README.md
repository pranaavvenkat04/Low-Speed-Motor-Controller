# Low Speed Motor Controller 

## Description
- Skills: Project Management · Software Development · Python · Raspberry Pi · Linux · Software Documentation · Electrical Design · Operating Systems
- NASA prototype that developed a method for controlling precise motion of a Brushless DC (BLDC) motor using relatively inexpensive components. This technology uses a method to control BLDC motors over a broad range of speeds, ranging from about 0.025 rpm to about 7000 rpm. It can be integrated into surgical robots that require advanced precision motion control systems.
- Engineered a small system using a Raspberry Pi and a motor controller with a custom program which implements NASA's algorithm that modifies the electrical signals to the motor that allows a DC brushless motor to move at a lower speed.
